# PERPETUA 🌀

**The Infinite Thought Engine**

> "Perpetua never stops. Neither should your curiosity."

Perpetua is an AI-powered exploration engine that transforms how you research, learn, and create. Give it any question or curiosity, and watch as it autonomously discovers, questions, solves, challenges, searches, imagines, and builds — endlessly.

Built with Claude's Extended Thinking and Computer Use capabilities.

## ✨ What Makes Perpetua Special

**Traditional AI:**
```
You: "Research quantum computing"
AI: [Gives you a summary]
You: [Still need to do all the work]
```

**Perpetua:**
```
You: "Research quantum computing applications in finance"
Perpetua:
  → Autonomously explores the topic
  → Finds deeper problems and questions
  → Generates solutions
  → Challenges assumptions
  → Researches the web
  → Imagines possibilities
  → Creates artifacts

[Come back to dozens of insights and working prototypes]
```
